                    ℹ️ Overview: The NOAA Coral Reef Watch (CRW) coral bleaching
                    Degree Heating Week (DHW) product shows accumulated heat
                    stress, which can lead to coral bleaching and death.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is a risk of coral bleaching when the DHW value
                    reaches 4 °C-weeks. By the time the DHW value reaches 8
                    °C-weeks, reef-wide coral bleaching with mortality of
                    heat-sensitive corals is likely. If the accumulated heat
                    stress continues to build further and exceeds a DHW value of
                    12 °C-weeks, multi-species mortality becomes likely. At a
                    DHW greater than or equal to 16 °C-weeks, there is a risk of
                    severe, multi-species mortality (in over 50% of corals), and
                    at a DHW greater than or equal to 20 °C-weeks, near complete
                    mortality (in over 80% of corals) is likely.

                    feature within the area of interest. This value is divided
                    by the total value of each feature to obtain the % contained
