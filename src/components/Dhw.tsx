                  ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview: The NOAA Coral Reef Watch (CRW) coral bleaching
                  Degree Heating Week (DHW) product shows accumulated heat
                  stress, which can lead to coral bleaching and death.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is a risk of coral bleaching when the DHW value reaches
                  4 ¬∞C-weeks. By the time the DHW value reaches 8 ¬∞C-weeks,
                  reef-wide coral bleaching with mortality of heat-sensitive
                  corals is likely. If the accumulated heat stress continues to
                  build further and exceeds a DHW value of 12 ¬∞C-weeks,
                  multi-species mortality becomes likely. At a DHW greater than
                  or equal to 16 ¬∞C-weeks, there is a risk of severe,
                  multi-species mortality (in over 50% of corals), and at a DHW
                  greater than or equal to 20 ¬∞C-weeks, near complete mortality
                  (in over 80% of corals) is likely.
